\section{What LUGs exist?}

Since this document is meant as a guide not only to maintaining and
growing LUGs but also to founding them, we should, before going further,
discuss what LUGs already exist.




\subsection{LUG lists}

There are several LUG lists on the Web. If you are considering founding a
LUG, your first task should be to find any nearby existing LUGs.
{\itshape Your best bet may be to join a LUG already established in your area,
rather than founding one.\/}

As of 2016, there were LUGs in 43 US states, seven of Canada's ten provinces, 
all six of Australia's states plus the Australian Capital Territory, in 76 
locations in India, and over 100 other countries, including Russia, China, most 
of Western and Eastern Europe, and many parts of Africa, Asia, South America, 
Central America, Oceania, and the Caribbean.  (This does not include Linux 
groups internal to 
\emph{Meetup.com} \texttt{\abyurl}
.)

 (lists FSF affiliates only)
\item

 (however, a/o 2022, seems neglected since June 2001)
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Solidarity versus convenience}

While (most) LUG lists on the Web are well-maintained, likely they don't
list every LUG. If considering founding a LUG, I suggest, in addition to
consulting these lists, posting a message to 
\emph{comp.os.linux.announce} \texttt{\aciurl}
, 
\emph{comp.os.linux.misc} \texttt{\acjurl}
, or an
appropriate regional Usenet hierarchy, inquiring about nearby LUGs. You
should also lodge a query (mailing list post, comment during a meeting)
at any existing LUG you are aware of anywhere near your area,
about LUGs near you.  If no such (nearby) LUG exists, your postings will
alert potential members to your initiative.

Carefully balance convenience against solidarity:  If a LUG exists in
your metropolitan area but on the other side of the city, starting a new
group may be better for convenience's sake. On the other hand, joining
the other group may be better for reasons of unity and solidarity.
{\bfseries {\itshape Greater numbers almost always means greater power, influence,
and efficiency\/}}. While two groups of 100 members each might be
nice, one with 200 has advantages. Of course, if you live in a small
town or village, any group is better than none.

The point is that starting a LUG is a significant undertaking, which
should be commenced with all relevant facts and some appreciation of the
effect on other groups.
